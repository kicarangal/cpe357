1.   I used my laptop with SSH Secure Shell.
2.   I read the intro and learned useful tools for navigation through files as well
     as simple tools such as creation and deletion. 
3.   I chose vim because a lot of people use it and it has a ton of useful tools.
     I read vimtutor and it took me some time.  It will take some getting use to 
     but as I get more familiar with vim, I'll start using them more and more.
4.   I did not encounter any problems.
